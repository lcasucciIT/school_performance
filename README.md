# school_performance
EDA and forecast of student grades based on survey data with socio-economic information and school performance
Does alcohol affect studentsâ€™ grades? If not, what does? 
This data was obtained in a survey from students in math courses in secondary school. 
It contains several variables like alcohol consumption, family size, involvement in extracurriculars.
Using this, I will explore the relationship between school performance and various factors, and try to predict the students' grades.
